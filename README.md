# Understanding Statistical Learning Theory

**Authors:** Manika Singh, Sabha Amrin, Gaurav Singh Parihar, Seema Verma  
**Project Type:** Academic Research – Machine Learning Task 3  
**Topic:** Machine Learning Theory (Bias-Variance, VC Dimension, Overfitting, SVM)

---

##  Overview

This project explores the theoretical foundations of machine learning and implements core concepts through visualizations and simulations. It focuses on the following key theoretical principles:

- **Bias-Variance Trade-off**
- **VC-Dimension**
- **Overfitting and Underfitting**
- **Decision Boundaries**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

These concepts form the backbone of understanding how machine learning models learn and generalize from data.

##  Key Topics

###  Bias-Variance Trade-off
Explains how model performance depends on the balance between bias (oversimplification) and variance (overfitting). Includes derivations and real-world examples such as disease prediction and fraud detection.

###  VC-Dimension
Introduces a formal measure of model complexity, showing how many points a model can "shatter". This helps understand capacity control and sample complexity.

###  Overfitting and Underfitting
Defines these common modeling problems, their causes, visualizations, effects, and how to address them using regularization, cross-validation, and more.

###  Decision Boundaries
Describes how models draw boundaries to separate classes, varying from linear to non-linear, piecewise, probabilistic, and clustering-based.

###  Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Detailed explanation of SVMs, kernel tricks, hyperplane optimization (primal and dual forms), margin maximization, and types of kernels like linear, polynomial, and RBF.
