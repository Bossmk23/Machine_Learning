# Machine Learning Theoretical Frameworks & SVM Implementation

## Overview

This repository contains code and documentation related to the theoretical study and practical implementation of key machine learning concepts covered during Days 31–45 of my research project.

The main focus areas include:

- **Statistical Learning Theory:**  
  Understanding the bias-variance trade-off, Vapnik–Chervonenkis (VC) dimension, and challenges of overfitting and underfitting.

- **Kernel Methods and Support Vector Machines (SVMs):**  
  Detailed exploration of SVMs, kernel tricks, decision boundary visualization, and optimization techniques.

## Contents

- `bias_variance_experiments/`  
  Python notebooks and scripts demonstrating bias-variance trade-offs with synthetic and real datasets.

- `svm_implementations/`  
  Custom SVM implementations and scikit-learn based examples with various kernel functions.

- `mathematical_derivations.md`  
  A detailed document containing mathematical derivations and theoretical explanations underpinning bias-variance trade-off, VC dimension, and SVM optimization.

- `README.md`  
  This file.

## Usage

- To run experiments on bias-variance trade-off, navigate to the `bias_variance_experiments/` folder and execute the Jupyter notebooks.  
- For SVM implementation details, explore the `svm_implementations/` folder for both custom code and scikit-learn examples.

## Deliverables

- Draft research paper with detailed mathematical derivations and theoretical insights.  
- Code demonstrations for practical understanding of bias-variance trade-off and SVMs.  
- Publicly accessible repository showcasing experiments and implementations.

## Tools and Libraries

- Python 3.x  
- scikit-learn
